<b>How to install</b>
<ul>
    <li>Download or Clone this repo.</li>
    <li>Make sure you have <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node#installing-npm-from-the-nodejs-site">Node.JS and npm</a> installed. Aswell as the <a href="https://cli.angular.io/">angular-cli</a>. Without these, you can't run the project.</li>
    <li>Open the project folder in cmd.exe, PowerShell or any terminal (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&ei=CxAMW5T7Ccr2kwXPu4ywBg&q=how+to+open+a+folder+in+cmd&oq=how+to+open+a+folder+in+cmd">?</a>), and run <code>npm install</code>. This will install all necessary packages for the project automatically as defined in the package.json file.</li>
    <li>After npm is done installing all dependencies, run <code>ng serve --open</code>. This might take a while on the first try, so hold your horses. You only need to run this command if you want to start it up again after you've already done step 1 to 3 before.</li>
    <li>Tada! You should see the webapp open in your browser.</li>
    <li>To stop the process, simply close the browser window and then in your terminal press <code>CTRL + C</code> and then type 'yes' when asked to terminate the program.</li>
</ul> 
<b>Notes</b>
<p>If the application is hard to run and you don't understand it, i'm sorry. Perhaps it is best if you have some experience with running angular projects when using this app. You can use the live demo online on my domain, but i cannot guarantee full up-time and latest releases. That said, the app doesn't use an api, it loads its two main data files (monsters.json / spells.json) from the assets folder. Maybe when I put this app online somewhere I will link an api to it, so I can remotely update the monster database. This web app is not optimalized for mobile (yet) so I highly recommend using a normal desktop browser.</p>

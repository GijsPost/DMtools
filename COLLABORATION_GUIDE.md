# About collaborating

<p>Currently, collaboration is only allowed for people I personally invited. Depending on the scale of the project, this might change.</p>
<p>I use two branches: </p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>master:</b> Is always a stable version and ready for release. This branch is downloadable and is where updates from develop eventually get published. As collaborator you cannot directly push to this branch, you have to make a pull request for it.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>develop:</b> Is the main development branch. Every now and then new features and updates will be pushed here. Some ends might be unfinished though. As collaborator you are free to push to this branch, although I recommend merging with your own branch.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to build something, make a new branch from DEVELOP! not master. Then, when you're done, merge develop to your branch if commits have been made to develop while you were working, and then push to develop or make a PR if you're a decent human being.</p>
